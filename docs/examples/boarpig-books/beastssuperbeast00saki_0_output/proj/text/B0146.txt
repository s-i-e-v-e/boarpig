in sables and the dogs will all have coats on. Then
I've got a great idea for the fifth verse; each of
the dogs will be led on by a Nut, and Cousin Teresa
will come on from the opposite side, crossing en
route, always effective, and then she turns round and
leads the whole lot of them off on a string, and all the
time every one singing like mad:

Fido, Jock, and the big borzoi.)

Tum-Tum! Drum business on the two last syllables.
I'm so excited, I shan't sleep a wink to-night. I'm
off to-morrow by the ten-fifteen. I've wired to
Hermanova to lunch with me.”

over the creation of Cousin Teresa, they were signally
successful in concealing the fact.
