“Didn't you take them out in your car?” asked
Blanche Boveal, addressing herself to Cyril Skatterly.

“Yes, took them out to Slogberry Moor imme-
diately after breakfast. Miss Durmot came too.”

“I saw you and Vera come back,” said Lady
Blonze, “but I didn't see the Klammersteins.
Did you put them down in the village?”

“No,” said Skatterly shortly.

“But where are they? Where did you leave
them?”

“We left them on Slogberry Moor,” said Vera
calmly.

“On Slogberry Moor? Why, it's more than thirty
miles away! How are they going to get back?”

“We didn't stop to consider that,” said Skat-
terly; “we asked them to get out for a moment,
on the pretence that the car had stuck, and then we
dashed off full speed and left them there.”

“But how dare you do such a thing? It's most
inhuman! Why, it's been snowing for the last hour.”

“I expect there'll be a cottage or farmhouse
somewhere if they walk a mile or two.”

“But why on earth have you done it?”

The question came in a chorus of indignant
bewilderment.

“(:i That) would be telling what our characters are
meant to be,” said Vera.
