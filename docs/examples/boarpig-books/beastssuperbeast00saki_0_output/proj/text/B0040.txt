“DORA BITTHOLZ is coming on Thurs
day,” said Mrs. Sangrail.

“This next Thursday?” asked Clovis

His mother nodded.

“You've rather done it, haven't you?” he
chuckled; “Jane Martlet has only been here five
days, and she never stays less than a fortnight,
even when she's asked definitely for a week. You'll
never get her out of the house by Thursday.”

“Why should I?” asked Mrs. Sangrail; “she
and Dora are good friends, aren't they? They
used to be, as far as I remember.”

“They used to be; that's what makes them all
the more bitter now. Each feels that she has
nursed a viper in her bosom. Nothing fans the
flame of human resentment so much as the discovery
that one's bosom has been utilised as a snake
sanatorium.”

“But what has happened? Has some one been
making mischief?”
