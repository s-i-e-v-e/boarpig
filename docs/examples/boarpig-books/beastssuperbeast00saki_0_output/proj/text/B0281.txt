(fw (h THE LUMBER ROOM)(pg 281))

or wood-pigeon; here were herons and bustards,
kites, toucans, tiger-bitterns, brush turkeys, ibises,
golden pheasants, a whole portrait gallery of un-
dreamed-of creatures. And as he was admiring
the colouring of the mandarin duck and assigning
a life-history to it, the voice of his aunt in shrill
vociferation of his name came from the gooseberry
garden without. She had grown suspicious at his
long disappearance, and had leapt to the conclusion
that he had climbed over the wall behind the shelter-
ing screen of the lilac bushes; she was now engaged
in energetic and rather hopeless search for him
among the artichokes and raspberry canes.

“Nicholas, Nicholas!” she screamed, “you are
to come out of this at once. It's no use trying to
hide there; I can see you all the time.”

It was probably the first time for twenty years
that anyone had smiled in that lumber-room.

Presently the angry repetitions of Nicholas'
name gave way to a shriek, and a cry for somebody
to come quickly. Nicholas shut the book, restored
it carefully to its place in a corner, and shook some
dust from a neighbouring pile of newspapers over
it. Then he crept from the room, locked the door,
and replaced the key exactly where he had found it.
His aunt was still calling his name when he sauntered
into the front garden.
