something between a gasp and a scream.

“The Duchess and I are both thinking of going
on strike,” said the Duke.

“Strike!”

The baleful word flashed out in all its old hideous
familiarity. Was there to be no end to its recur-
rence?

“Do you mean,” faltered the reporter, “that you
are contemplating a mutual withdrawal of the
charges?”

“Precisely,” said the Duke.
