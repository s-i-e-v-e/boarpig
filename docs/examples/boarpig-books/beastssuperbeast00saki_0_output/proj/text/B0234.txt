“Were there any sheep in the park?” demanded
Cyril.

“No;” said the bachelor, “there were no sheep.”

“Why weren't there any sheep?” came the
inevitable question arising out of that answer.

The aunt permitted herself a smile, which might
almost have been described as a grin.

“There were no sheep in the park,” said the
bachelor, “because the Prince's mother had once
had a dream that her son would either be killed by
a sheep or else by a clock falling on him. For that
reason the Prince never kept a sheep in his park or
a clock in his palace.”

The aunt suppressed a gasp of admiration.

“Was the Prince killed by a sheep or by a clock?”
asked Cyril.

“He is still alive, so we can't tell whether the
dream will come true,” said the bachelor unconcern-
edly; “anyway, there were no sheep in the park,
but there were lots of little pigs running all over the
place.”

“What colour were they?”

“Black with white faces, white with black spots,
black all over, grey with white patches, and some
were white all over.”
