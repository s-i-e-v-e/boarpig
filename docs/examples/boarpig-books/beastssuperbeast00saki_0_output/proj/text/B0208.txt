facts of life stick in one's memory. There's my
cousin, Editha Clubberley, for instance; I can never
forget that her birthday is on the 12th of October.
It's a matter of utter indifference to me on what date
her birthday falls, or whether she was born at all;
either fact seems to me absolutely trivial, or unnec-
essary—I've heaps of other cousins to go on with.
On the other hand, when I'm staying with Hilde-
garde Shrubley I can never remember the important
circumstance whether her first husband got his
unenviable reputation on the Turf or the Stock
Exchange, and that uncertainty rules Sport and
Finance out of the conversation at once. One can
never mention travel, either, because her second
husband had to live permanently abroad.”

“Mrs. Shrubley and I move in very different
circles,” said Mrs. Eggelby stiffly.

“No one who knows Hildegarde could possibly
accuse her of moving in a circle,” said Clovis; “her
view of life seems to be a non-stop run with an inex-
haustible supply of petrol. If she can get some one
else to pay for the petrol so much the better. I
don't mind confessing to you that she has taught me
more than any other woman I can think of.”

“What kind of knowledge?” demanded Mrs.
Eggelby, with the air a jury might collectively wear
when finding a verdict without leaving the box.
