Amanda looked quickly and furtively across at
Sir Lulworth.

Egbert was too agitated to eat any breakfast, and
went out to superintend the strengthening of the
poultry yard defences.

“I think she might at least have waited till the
funeral was over,” said Amanda in a scandalised
voice.

“It's her own funeral, you know,” said Sir Lul-
worth; “it's a nice point in etiquette how far one
ought to show respect to one's own mortal
remains.”

Disregard for mortuary convention was carried
to further lengths next day; during the absence
of the family at the funeral ceremony the remaining
survivors of the speckled Sussex were massacred.
The marauder's line of retreat seemed to have
embraced most of the flower beds on the lawn, but
the strawberry beds in the lower garden had also
suffered.

“I shall get the otter hounds to come here at the
earliest possible moment,” said Egbert savagely.

“On no account! You can't dream of such a
thing!” exclaimed Amanda. “I mean, it wouldn't
do, so soon after a funeral in the house.”

“It's a case of necessity,” said Egbert; “once
an otter takes to that sort of thing it won't stop.”
