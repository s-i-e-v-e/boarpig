“Well, among other things, she's introduced me
to at least four different ways of cooking lobster,”
said Clovis gratefully. “That, of course, wouldn't
appeal to you; people who abstain from the pleasures
of the card-table never really appreciate the finer
possibilities of the dining-table. I suppose their
powers of enlightened enjoyment get atrophied
from disuse.”

“An aunt of mine was very ill after eating a
lobster,” said Mrs. Eggelby.

“I daresay, if we knew more of her history, we
should find out that she'd often been ill before eating
the lobster. Aren't you concealing the fact that
she'd had measles and influenza and nervous head-
ache and hysteria, and other things that aunts do
have, long before she ate the lobster? Aunts that
have never known a day's illness are very rare; in
fact, I don't personally know of any. Of course
if she ate it as a child of two weeks old it might
have been her first illness—and her last. But if
that was the case I think you should have said
