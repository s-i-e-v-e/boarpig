of a lady who had wriggled her way with unstayable
determination towards the bareheaded Cyprian,
and was now breathlessly demanding the sale price
of a handbag which had taken her fancy.

“There now, exclaimed Adela to herself, “she takes
him for one of the shop assistants because he hasn't
got a hat on. I wonder it hasn't happened before.”

Perhaps it had. Cyprian, at any rate, seemed
neither startled nor embarrassed by the error into
which the good lady had fallen. Examining the
ticket on the bag, he announced in a clear, dispas-
sionate voice:

“Black seal, thirty-four shillings, marked down
to twenty-eight. As a matter of fact, we are clearing
them out at a special reduction price of twenty-
six shillings. They are going off rather fast.”

“I'll take it,” said the lady, eagerly digging some
coins out of her purse.

“Will you take it as it is?” asked Cyprian; “it
will be a matter of a few minutes to get it wrapped
up, there is such a crush.”

“Never mind, I'll take it as it is,” said the pur-
chaser, clutching her treasure and counting the money
into Cyprian's palm.
