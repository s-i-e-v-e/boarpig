might possess, it certainly failed to receive com-

to be noticeable; the half-bottle of cheap claret
at dinner-time gave way to a small glass of lager,
and this in turn was displaced by water. The one-
and-sixpenny set dinner receded from an everyday
event to a Sunday extravagance; on ordinary
days the artist contented himself with a sevenpenny
omelette and some bread and cheese, and there
were evenings when he did not put in an appear-
ance at all. On the rare occasions when he spoke
of his own affairs it was observed that he began to
talk more about Pomerania and less about the
great world of art.

“It is a busy time there now with us,” he said
wistfully; “the schwines are driven out into
the fields after harvest, and must be looked
after. I could be helping to look after if I was
there. Here it is difficult to live; art is not
appreciate.”
