to supply Bertie with a wife, but she kept the thought
to herself.

Mrs. Yonelet was a woman of resourceful energy
and generalship; she involved the other members
of the house-party, the deadweight, so to speak, in
all manner of exercises and occupations that segre-
gated them from Bertie and Dora, who were left
to their own devisings—that is to say, to Dora's
devisings and Bertie's accommodating acquies-
cence. Dora helped in the Christmas decorations
of the parish church, and Bertie helped her to help.
Together they fed the swans, till the birds went on
a dyspepsia-strike, together they played billiards,
together they photographed the village almshouses,
and, at a respectful distance, the tame elk that
browsed in solitary aloofness in the park. It was
“tame” in the sense that it had long ago discarded
the least vestige of fear of the human race; nothing
in its record encouraged its human neighbours to
feel a reciprocal confidence.

Whatever sport or exercise or occupation Bertie
and Dora indulged in together was unfailingly
chronicled and advertised by Mrs. Yonelet for the
due enlightenment of Bertie's grandmother.

“Those two inseparables have just come in from
a bicycle ride,” she would announce; “quite a pic-
ture they make, so fresh and glowing after their spin.”
