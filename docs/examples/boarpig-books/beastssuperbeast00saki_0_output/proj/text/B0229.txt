(h THE STORY-TELLER)

IT was a hot afternoon, and the railway carriage
was correspondingly sultry, and the next
stop was at Templecombe, nearly an hour
ahead. The occupants of the carriage were a small
girl, and a smaller girl, and a small boy. An aunt
belonging to the children occupied one corner seat,
and the further corner seat on the opposite side was
occupied by a bachelor who was a stranger to their
party, but the small girls and the small boy emphati-
cally occupied the compartment. Both the aunt
and the children were conversational in a limited,
persistent way, reminding one of the attentions of a
housefly that refuses to be discouraged. Most of
the aunt's remarks seemed to begin with “Don't,”
and nearly all of the children's remarks began with
“Why?” The bachelor said nothing out loud.

“Don't, Cyril, don't,” exclaimed the aunt, as
the small boy began smacking the cushions of the
seat, producing a cloud of dust at each blow.

“Come and look out of the window,” she added.
