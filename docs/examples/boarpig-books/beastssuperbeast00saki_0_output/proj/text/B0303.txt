(:h ON APPROVAL)

OF all the genuine Bohemians who strayed
from time to time into the would-be
Bohemian circle of the Restaurant Nurem-
berg, Owl Street, Soho, none was more interesting
and more elusive than Gebhard Knopfschrank.
He had no friends, and though he treated all the
restaurant frequenters as acquaintances he never
seemed to wish to carry the acquaintanceship beyond
the door that led into Owl Street and the outer world.
He dealt with them all rather as a market woman
might deal with chance passers-by, exhibiting her
wares and chattering about the weather and the
slackness of business, occasionally about rheumatism,
but never showing a desire to penetrate into their
daily lives or to dissect their ambitions.

He was understood to belong to a family of peasant
farmers, somewhere in Pomerania; some two years
ago, according to all that was known of him, he had
abandoned the labours and responsibilities of
swine tending and goose rearing to try his fortune
as an artist in London.
