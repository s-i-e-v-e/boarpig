“But the motive?” exclaimed Sir Lulworth;
“no one had any interest in doing away with him,
and the number of people who destroy Canons of the
Established Church for the mere fun of killing must
be extremely limited. Of course there are indivi-
duals of weak mental balance who do that sort of
thing, but they seldom conceal their handiwork;
they are more generally inclined to parade it.”

“His cook was under suspicion,” said Egbert
shortly.

“I know he was,” said Sir Lulworth, “simply
because he was about the only person on the
premises at the time of the tragedy. But could
anything be sillier than trying to fasten a charge of
murder on to Sebastien? He had nothing to gain,
in fact, a good deal to lose, from the death of his
employer. The Canon was paying him quite as
good wages as I was able to offer him when I took
him over into my service. I have since raised them
to something a little more in accordance with his
real worth, but at the time he was glad to find a new
place without troubling about an increase of wages.
People were fighting rather shy of him, and he had
no friends in this country. No; if anyone in the
world was interested in the prolonged life and unim-
paired digestion of the Canon it would certainly be
Sebastien.”
