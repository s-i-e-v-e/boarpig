almost any sort of horse with the West Wessex as
long as it is an animal that knows the country.
The Brogue knew the country intimately, having
personally created most of the gaps that were to
be met with in banks and hedges for many miles
round. His manners and characteristics were not
ideal in the hunting field, but he was probably
rather safer to ride to hounds than he was as a hack
on country roads. According to the Mullet family,
he was not really road-shy, but there were one or
two objects of dislike that brought on sudden attacks
of what Toby called the swerving sickness. Motors
and cycles he treated with tolerant disregard, but
pigs, wheelbarrows, piles of stones by the roadside,
perambulators in a village street, gates painted too
aggressively white, and sometimes, but not always,
the newer kind of beehives, turned him aside from
his tracks in vivid imitation of the zigzag course of
forked lightning. If a pheasant rose noisily from
the other side of a hedgerow the Brogue would spring
into the air at the same moment, but this may have
been due to a desire to be companionable. The
Mullet family contradicted the widely prevalent
report that the horse was a confirmed crib-biter.
