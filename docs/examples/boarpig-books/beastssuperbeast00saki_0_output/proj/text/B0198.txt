(:h THE STAKE)

“RONNIE is a great trial to me,” said Mrs.
Attray plaintively. “Only eighteen
years old last February and already
a confirmed gambler. I am sure I don't know where
he inherits it from; his father never touched cards,
and you know how little I play—a game of bridge
on Wednesday afternoons in the winter, for three-
pence a hundred, and even that I shouldn't do if
it wasn't that Edith always wants a fourth and
would be certain to ask that detestable Jenkinham
woman if she couldn't get me. I would much rather
sit and talk any day than play bridge; cards are
such a waste of time, I think. But as to Ronnie,
bridge and baccarat and poker-patience are posi-
tively all that he thinks about. Of course I've done
my best to stop it; I've asked the Norridrums not
to let him play cards when he's over there, but you
might as well ask the Atlantic Ocean to keep quiet
for a crossing as expect them to bother about a
mother's natural anxieties.”
