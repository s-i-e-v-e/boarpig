Kleophä would not permit it,” said the woman with
provoking calm.

The heads dropped down from the window and
an uncanny silence fell on the beleaguered carriage.
Abbleway neither moved nor spoke. Perhaps the
brutes had not clearly seen or winded the human
occupants of the carriage, and had prowled away on
some other errand of rapine.

The long torture-laden minutes passed slowly away.

“It grows cold,” said the woman suddenly,
crossing over to the far end of the carriage, where the
heads had appeared. “The heating apparatus does
not work any longer. See, over there beyond the
trees, there is a chimney with smoke coming from
it. It is not far, and the snow has nearly stopped.
I shall find a path through the forest to that house
with the chimney.”

“But the wolves!” exclaimed Abbleway; “they
may——”

“Not on my name-day,” said the woman obstin-
ately, and before he could stop her she had opened
the door and climbed down into the snow. A moment
later he hid his face in his hands; two gaunt lean
figures rushed upon her from the forest. No doubt
she had courted her fate, but Abbleway had no
wish to see a human being torn to pieces and devoured
before his eyes.
