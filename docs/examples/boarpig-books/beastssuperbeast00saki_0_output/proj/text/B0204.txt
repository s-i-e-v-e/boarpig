said Ronald hurriedly; “the fact is, I was dining
at the Norridrums' yesterday, and they were wishing
they had a swell cook like yours, just for to-day and
to-morrow, while they've got some gourmet staying
with them: their own cook is no earthly good—well,
you've seen what she turns out when she's at all
flurried. So I thought it would be rather sporting
to play them at baccarat for the loan of our cook
against a money stake, and I lost, that's all. I have
had rotten luck at baccarat all this year.”

The remainder of his explanation, of how he had
assured the cooks that the temporary transfer had
his mother's sanction, and had smuggled the one
out and the other in during the maternal absence,
was drowned in the outcry of scandalised upbraiding.

“If I had sold the woman into slavery there
couldn't have been a bigger fuss about it,” he con-
fided afterwards to Bertie Norridrum, “and Eleanor
Saxelby raged and ramped the louder of the two.
I tell you what, I'll bet you two of the Amherst
pheasants to five shillings that she refuses to have
me as a partner at the croquet tournament. We're
drawn together, you know.”

This time he won his bet.
