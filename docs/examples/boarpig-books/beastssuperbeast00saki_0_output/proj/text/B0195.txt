(fw (h THE FORBIDDEN BUZZARDS)(pg 195))

“I was going to suggest picketing,” said Clovis.

“Picketing! You mean setting guards round
the birds?”

“No; round Lanner. He can't find his way
through those woods by night, and you could arrange
that you or Evelyn or Jack or the German governess
should be by his side in relays all day long. A
fellow guest he could get rid of, but he couldn't
very well shake off members of the household, and
even the most determined collector would hardly
go climbing after forbidden buzzards' eggs with a
German governess hanging round his neck, so to
speak.”

Lanner, who had been lazily watching for an
opportunity for prosecuting his courtship of the
Coulterneb girl, found presently that his chances
of getting her to himself for ten minutes even were
non-existent. If the girl was ever alone he never
was. His hostess had changed suddenly, as far
as he was concerned, from the desirable type that
lets her guests do nothing in the way that best
pleases them, to the sort that drags them over the
ground like so many harrows. She showed him
the herb garden and the greenhouses, the village
church, some water-colour sketches that her sister
had done in Corsica, and the place where it was
hoped that celery would grow later in the year.
