It was her friend and neighbour, Aurora Burret,
who brought her news of the day's sport.

“Pity you weren't out; we had quite a good day.
We found at once, in the pool just below your
garden.”

“Did you—kill?” asked Amanda.

“Rather. A fine she-otter. Your husband got
rather badly bitten in trying to ‘tail it.’ Poor beast,
I felt quite sorry for it, it had such a human look
in its eyes when it was killed. You'll call me silly,
but do you know who the look reminded me of? My
dear woman, what is the matter?”

When Amanda had recovered to a certain extent
from her attack of nervous prostration Egbert took
her to the Nile Valley to recuperate. Change of
scene speedily brought about the desired recovery of
health and mental balance. The escapades of an
adventurous otter in search of a variation of diet
were viewed in their proper light. Amanda's
normally placid temperament reasserted itself.
Even a hurricane of shouted curses, coming from her
husband's dressing-room, in her husband's voice,
but hardly in his usual vocabulary, failed to disturb
her serenity as she made a leisurely toilet one evening
in a Cairo hotel.

“What is the matter? What has happened?”
she asked in amused curiosity.
