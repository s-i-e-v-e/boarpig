you quite sure, my dear, that you're wise in doing
this thing?” he said to his wife when they were
alone together. “It might do very well at the
Mathesons, where they had rather a staid, elderly
house-party, but here it will be a different matter.
There is the Durmot flapper, for instance, who
simply stops at nothing, and you know what Van
Tahn is like. Then there is Cyril Skatterly; he
has madness on one side of his family and a Hungarian
grandmother on the other.”

“I don't see what they could do that would
matter,” said Lady Blonze.

“It's the unknown that is to be dreaded,” said Sir
Nicholas. “If Skatterly took it into his head to re-
present a Bull of Bashan, well, I'd rather not be here.”

“Of course we shan't allow any Bible characters.
Besides, I don't know what the Bulls of Bashan
really did that was so very dreadful; they just
came round and gaped, as far as I remember.”

“My dear, you don't know what Skatterly's
Hungarian imagination mightn't read into the
part; it would be small satisfaction to say to him
afterwards: ‘You've behaved as no Bull of Bashan
would have behaved.’”

“Oh, you're an alarmist,” said Lady Blonze;
“I particularly want to have this idea carried out.
It will be sure to be talked about a lot.”
