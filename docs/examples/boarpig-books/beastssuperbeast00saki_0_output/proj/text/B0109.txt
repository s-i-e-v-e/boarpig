attained to a recognised brevet of importance through
the fact of an uncle having dropped dead in the act
of voting at a Parliamentary election. That had
happened three years ago, but Stevenham was still
deferred to on all questions of home and foreign
politics.

“Hullo, how's the giant mushroom, or whatever
it was?” was all the notice Blenkinthrope got from
his fellow travellers.

Young Duckby, whom he mildly disliked, speedily
monopolised the general attention by an account of
a domestic bereavement.

“Had four young pigeons carried off last night
by a whacking big rat. Oh, a monster he must
have been; you could tell by the size of the hole
he made breaking into the loft.”

No moderate-sized rat ever seemed to carry out
any predatory operations in these regions; they
were all enormous in their enormity.

“Pretty hard lines that,” continued Duckby,
seeing that he had secured the attention and respect
of the company; “four squeakers carried off at
one swoop. You'd find it rather hard to match
that in the way of unlooked-for bad luck.”

“I had six pullets out of a pen of seven killed by a
snake yesterday afternoon,” said Blenkinthrope,
in a voice which he hardly recognised as his own.
