“Perhaps it will go elsewhere now there are no
more fowls left,” suggested Amanda.

“One would think you wanted to shield the beast,”
said Egbert.

“There's been so little water in the stream lately,”
objected Amanda; “it seems hardly sporting to
hunt an animal when it has so little chance of taking
refuge anywhere.”

“Good gracious!” fumed Egbert, “I'm not
thinking about sport. I want to have the animal
killed as soon as possible.”

Even Amanda's opposition weakened when, during
church time on the following Sunday, the otter
made its way into the house, raided half a salmon
from the larder and worried it into scaly fragments
on the Persian rug in Egbert's studio.

“We shall have it hiding under our beds and biting
pieces out of our feet before long,” said Egbert, and
from what Amanda knew of this particular otter
she felt that the possibility was not a remote one.

On the evening preceding the day fixed for the
hunt Amanda spent a solitary hour walking by the
banks of the stream, making what she imagined
to be hound noises. It was charitably supposed
by those who overheard her performance, that she
was practising for farmyard imitations at the forth-
coming village entertainment.
