“In our present imperfect understanding of these
hidden forces I think one should approach them

Leonard, with such severity that the subject was
forthwith dropped.

Clovis Sangrail had sat unusually silent during
the discussion on the possibilities of Siberian Magic;
after lunch he side-tracked Lord Pabham into the
comparative seclusion of the billiard-room and deliv-
ered himself of a searching question.

“Have you such a thing as a she-wolf in your
collection of wild animals? A she-wolf of moder-
ately good temper?”

Lord Pabham considered. “There is Louisa,”
he said, “a rather fine specimen of the timber-wolf.
I got her two years ago in exchange for some Arctic
foxes. Most of my animals get to be fairly tame
before they've been with me very long; I think I
can say Louisa has an angelic temper, as she-wolves
go. Why do you ask?”

“I was wondering whether you would lend her
to me for to-morrow night,” said Clovis, with the
careless solicitude of one who borrows a collar stud
or a tennis racquet.

“To-morrow night?”
