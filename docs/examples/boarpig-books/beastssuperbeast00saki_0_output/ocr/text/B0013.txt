LAURA

cc OU are not really dying, are you?” asked
Amanda.

“I have the doctor's permission to
live till Tuesday,” said Laura.

“But to-day is Saturday; this is serious!”
gasped Amanda.

“I don't know about it being serious; it is
certainly Saturday,” said Laura.

“Death is always serious,” said Amanda.

‘I never said I was going to die. I am presum-
ably going to leave off being Laura, but I shall go
on being something. An animal of some kind, I
suppose. You see, when one hasn't been very
good in the life one has just lived, one reincarnates
in some lower organism. And I haven't been very
good, when one comes to think of it. [ve been petty
and mean and vindictive and all that sort of thing
when circumstances have seemed to warrant it.”

“Circumstances never warrant that sort of
thing,’ said Amanda hastily.
