THE BROGUE 39

rectory gate was painted a dull unobtrusive green,
but it had been white a year or two ago, and the
Brogue never forgot that he had been in the habit
of making a violent curtsey, a back-pedal and a
swerve at this particular point of the road. Subse--
quently, there being apparently no further call on
his services, he broke his way into the rectory
orchard, where he found a hen turkey in a coop;
later visitors to the orchard found the coop almost
intact, but very little left of the turkey.

Mr. Penricarde, a little stunned and _ shaken,
and suffering from a bruised knee and some minor
damages, good-naturedly ascribed the accident to
his own inexperience with horses and country roads,
and allowed Jessie to nurse him back into complete
recovery and golf-fitness within something less than
a week,

In the list of wedding presents which the local
newspaper published a fortnight or so later appeared
the following item:

“Brown saddle-horse, ‘The Brogue,’ bridegroom's
gift to bride.”

_ “Which shows,” said Toby Mullet, ‘that he
knew nothing.”

“Or else,” said Clovis, “that he has a very
pleasing wit.”
