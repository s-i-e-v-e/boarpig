96 BEASTS AND SUPER-BEASTS

“At any other time, certainly,” said Crosby;
“in the months of November and December, how-
ever, it is absolutely forbidden for anyone of our
race to give or receive loans or gifts; in fact, one
does not willingly speak of them. It is considered
unlucky. We will therefore close this discussion.”

“But it is still October!” exclaimed the adven-
turer with an eager, angry whine, as Crosby rose
from his seat; “wants eight days to the end of the
month!”

“The Afghan November began yesterday,” said
Crosby severely, and in another moment he was
striding across the Park, leaving his recent companion
scowling and muttering furiously on the seat.

“I don't believe a word of his story,” he chattered
to himself; “pack of nasty lies from beginning to
end. Wish I'd told him so to his face. Calling
himself an Afghan!”

The snorts and snarls that escaped from him for
the next quarter of an hour went far to support the
truth of the old saying that two of a trade never

agree.
