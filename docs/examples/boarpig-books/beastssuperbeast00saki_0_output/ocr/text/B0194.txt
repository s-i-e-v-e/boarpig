1904 BEASTS AND SUPER-BEASTS

time they've nested. As you say, they are almost
the only pair known to be breeding in the whole
of Great Britain; and now their nest is going to be
harried by a guest staying under my roof. I must
do something to stop it. Do you think if I appealed
to him -

Clovis laughed.

“There is a story going about, which I fancy is
true in most of its details, of something that hap-
pened not long ago somewhere on the coast of the
Sea of Marmora, in which our friend had a hand.
A Syrian nightjar, or some such bird, was known
to be breeding in the olive gardens of a rich Armenian,
who for some reason or other wouldn't allow Lanner
to go in and take the eggs, though he offered cash
down for the permission. The Armenian was found
beaten nearly to death a day or two later, and his
fences levelled. It was assumed to be a case of
Mussulman aggression, and noted as such in all the
Consular reports, but the eggs are in the Lanner
collection. No, I don't think I should appeal to his
better feelings if | were you.”

“I must do something,” said Mrs. Olston tear-
fully; “my husband's parting words when he went
off to Norway were an injunction to see that those
birds were not disturbed, and he's asked about them
every time he's written. Do suggest something.”
