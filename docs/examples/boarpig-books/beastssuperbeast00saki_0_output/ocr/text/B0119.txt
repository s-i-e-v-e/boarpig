much to be done in the way of legal matters, but
I had to go through her papers.”
“That would be a fairly heavy task in itself.
I should imagine there were reams of family letters.”
“Stacks of them, and most of them highly unin--

I thought might repay a careful perusal. It was a
bundle of correspondence from her brother Peter.’
“The Canon of tragic memory,” said Lulworth.
“Exactly, of tragic memory, as you say; a
tragedy that has never been fathomed.”
“Probably the simplest explanation was the
correct one,’ said Sir Lulworth; “he slipped on
the stone staircase and fractured his skull in falling.”
Egbert shook his head. “The medical evidence

struck by some one coming up behind him. A wound
caused by violent contact with the steps could not
possibly have been inflicted at that angle of the
skull. They experimented with adummy figure falling
in every conceivable position.”
