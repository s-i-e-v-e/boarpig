went out of the hotel a few minutes ago, a tall lady,

“Certainly. She's a Mrs. Stroope.”

“Mrs.?” queried Jerton.

“Yes, she's the Lady Champion at golf in my
part of the world. An awful good sort, and goes
about a good deal in Society, but she has an awkward

I'll swear. Why—there 7s my luggage! and
the locks have been tampered with!”

Jerton heard no more. He flied down to the
Turkish bath, and stayed there for hours.
