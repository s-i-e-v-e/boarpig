LAURA 17

‘* that one can hardly set them down as being mad.
And Laura was such an unaccountable person in
this life that I should not like to lay down definite
rules as to what she might be doing in an after state.”

“You think she really might have passed into
some animal form?’ asked Amanda. She was
one of those who shape their opinions rather readily
from the standpoint of those around them.

Just then Egbert entered the breakfast-room,
wearing an air of bereavement that Laura's demise
would have been insufficient, in itself, to account for.

“Four of my speckled Sussex have been killed,”
he exclaimed; “the very four that were to go to
the show on Friday. One of them was dragged
away and eaten right in the middle of that new
carnation bed that I've been to such trouble and
expense over. My best flower bed and my best
fowls singled out for destruction; it almost seems
as if the brute that did the deed had special know--
ledge how to be as devastating as possible in a short
space of time.”

“Was it a fox, do you think?” asked Amanda.

“Sounds more like a polecat,” said Sir Lulworth.

“No,” said Egbert, “there were marks of webbed
feet all over the place, and we followed the tracks
down to the stream at the bottom of the garden;

evidently an otter.”
