258 BEASTS AND SUPER-BEASTS

“What did we send them?” asked Egbert
gloomily

“Bridge-markers,’ said Janetta, “in a card--
board case, with some inanity about ‘digging for
fortune with a royal spade’ emblazoned on the cover.
The moment I saw it in the shop I said to myself
‘Froplinsons’ and to the attendant “How much?’
When he said * Ninepence,’ I gave him their address,
jabbed our card in, paid tenpence or elevenpence
to cover the postage, and thanked heaven. With
less sincerity and infinitely more trouble they
eventually thanked me.”

‘The Froplinsons don't play bridge,” said Egbert.

“One is not supposed to notice social deformities
of that sort,” said Janetta; “it wouldn't be polite.
Besides, what trouble did they take to find out
whether we read Wordsworth with gladness?
For all they knew or cared we might be frantically
embedded in the belief that all poetry begins and
ends with John Masefield, and it might infuriate
or depress us to have a daily sample of Words--
worthian products flung at us.”

“Well, let's get on with the letter of thanks,”
said Egbert.

“Proceed,” said Janetta.

“** How clever of you to guess that Wordsworth
is our favourite poet,” dictated Egbert.
