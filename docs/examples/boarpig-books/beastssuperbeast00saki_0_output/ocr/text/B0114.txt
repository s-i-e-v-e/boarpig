and Blenkinthrope, in the false security of an
assured and receptive audience, waxed industrious
and ingenious in supplying the demand for marvels.
Duckby's satirical story of a tame otter that had a
tank in the garden to swim in, and whined restlessly
whenever the water-rate was overdue, was scarcely
an unfair parody of some of Blenkinthrope's wilder
efforts. And then one day came Nemesis.

Returning to his villa one evening Blenkinthrope
found his wife sitting in front of a pack of cards,
which she was scrutinising with unusual concentra-
tion.

“The same old patience-game?” he asked
carelessly.

“No, dear; this is the Death's Head patience,
the most difficult of them all. I've never got it
to work out, and somehow I should be rather fright-
ened if I did. Mother only got it out once in her
life; she was afraid of it, too. Her great-aunt had
done it once and fallen dead from excitement the
next moment, and mother always had a feeling that
she would die if she ever got it out. She died the same
night that she did it. She was in bad health at the
time, certainly, but it was a strange coincidence.”
