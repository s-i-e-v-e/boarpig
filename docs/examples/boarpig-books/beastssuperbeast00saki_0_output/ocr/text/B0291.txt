FUR 2Q1

girl. A fan is always useful; she'll be going to a
lot of dances at Davos this winter. Yes, I should
think a fan would please her more than anything.
After our birthdays are over we inspect each other's
muster of presents, and I always feel dreadfully
humble. She gets such nice things, and I never have
anything worth showing. You see, none of my
relations or any of the people who give me presents
are at all well off, so I can't expect them to do any--
thing more than just remember the day with some
little trifle. Two years ago an uncle on my mother's
side of the family, who had come into a small legacy,
promised me a silver-fox stole for my birthday. I
can't tell you how excited I was about it, how I
pictured myself showing it off to all my friends and
enemies. Then just at that moment his wife died,
and, of course, poor man, he could not be expected
to think of birthday presents at such a time. He has
lived abroad ever since, and I never got my fur.
Do you know, to this day I can scarcely look at a
silver-fox pelt in a shop window or round anyone's
neck without feeling ready to burst into tears. I
suppose if I hadn't had the prospect of getting one I
shouldn't feel that way. Look, there is the fan
counter, on your left; you can easily slip away in
the crowd. Get her as nice a one as you can see—
she is such a dear, dear girl.”
