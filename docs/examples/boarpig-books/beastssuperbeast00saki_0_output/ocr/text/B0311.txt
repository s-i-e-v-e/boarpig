ON APPROVAL 311

For the sum of ten shillings each Miss Strubble
acquired the drawings of the camel dying in Upper
Berkeley Street and of the giraffes quenching their
thirst in Trafalgar Square; at the same price Mrs.
Nougat-Jones secured the study of roosting sand-
grouse. A more ambitious picture, “Wolves and
wapiti fighting on the steps of the Athenzum Club,”
found a purchaser at fifteen shillings.

“* And now what are your plans?” asked a young
man who contributed occasional paragraphs to an
artistic weekly.

“I go back to Stolpmiinde as soon as the ship
sails,’ said the artist, “and I donot return. Never.”
“But your work? Your career as painter?”

“Ah, there is nossing in it. One starves. Till
to-day I have sold not one of my sketches. To-night
you have bought a few, because I am going away
from you, but at other times, not one.”

“But has not some American——?”

“Ah, the rich American,” chuckled the artist.
“God be thanked. He dash his car right into our
herd of schwines as they were being driven out to
the fields. Many of our best schwines he killed,
but he paid all damages. He paid perhaps more than
they were worth, many times more than they would
have fetched in the market after a month of fatten-
ing, but he was in a hurry to get on to Dantzig.
