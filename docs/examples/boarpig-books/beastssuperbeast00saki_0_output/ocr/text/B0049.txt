THE HEN 49

Jane sniffed slightly at Clovisâ€™ ideas of unneces--
sary alarm, and was almost rude to the young man
who came round with thoughtful inquiries as to
luncheon-baskets.

date of her visit, but, at any rate, Clovis holds the
record as the only human being who ever hustled
Jane Martlet out of the time-table of her migrations.
