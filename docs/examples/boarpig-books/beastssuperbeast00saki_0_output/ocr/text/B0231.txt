THE STORY-TELLER 231

over and over again in a dreamy but resolute and
very audible voice; it seemed to the bachelor as
though some one had had a bet with her that she
could not repeat the line aloud two thousand times
without stopping. Whoever it was who had made
the wager was likely to lose his bet.

“Come over here and listen to a story,” said the
aunt, when the bachelor had looked twice at her and
once at the communication cord.

The children moved listlessly towards the aunt's
end of the carriage. Evidently her reputation as a
story-teller did not rank high in their estimation.

In a low, confidential voice, interrupted at fre--
quent intervals by loud, petulant questionings from
her listeners, she began an unenterprising and
deplorably uninteresting story about a little girl
who was good, and made friends with every one on
account of her goodness, and was finally saved from
a mad bull by a number of rescuers who admired
her moral character.

“Wouldn't they have saved her if she hadn't been
good?” demanded the bigger of the small girls.
It was exactly the question that the bachelor had
wanted to ask.

“Well, yes,” admitted the aunt lamely, “but I
don't think they would have run quite so fast to
her help if they had not liked her so much.”
