connections in London! Of course I can wire to
my people for the address, but they won't have got
my letter till to-morrow; meantime I'm without
any money, came out with about a shilling on me,
which went in buying the soap and getting the drink,
and here I am, wandering about with twopence in
my pocket and nowhere to go for the night.”

There was an eloquent pause after the story had
been told. “I suppose you think I've spun you
rather an impossible yarn,” said the young man
presently,with a suggestion of resentment in his voice.

“Not at all impossible,” said Gortsby judicially;
“IT remember doing exactly the same thing once in
a foreign capital, and on that occasion there were
two of us, which made it more remarkable. Luckily
we remembered that the hotel was on a sort of canal,
and when we struck the canal we were able to find
our way back to the hotel.”

The youth brightened at the reminiscence. “In
a foreign city I wouldn't mind so much,” he said;
“one could go to one's Consul and get the requisite
help from him. Here in one's own land one is far
more derelict if one gets into a fix. Unless I can
find some decent chap to swallow my story and lend
me some money I seem likely to spend the night on
the Embankment. I'm glad, anyhow, that you

don't think the story outrageously improbable.”
