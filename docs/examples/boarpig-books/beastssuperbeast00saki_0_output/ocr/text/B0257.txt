DOWN PENS 257

“and I've had my usual business correspondence
to get through, too. Besides, I don't know what it
was that the Froplinsons sent us.”

“A William the Conqueror calendar,” said Jan--
etta, “with a quotation of one of his great thoughts
for every day in the year.”

“Impossible,” said Egbert; “he didn't have

_ three hundred and sixty-five thoughts in the whole
“ef his life, or, if he did, he kept them to himself.
He was a man of action, not of introspection.”

“Well, it was William Wordsworth, then,” said
Janetta; “I know William came into it some--
where.”

“That sounds more probable,’ said Egbert;
“well, let's collaborate on this letter of thanks
and get it done. I'll dictate, and you can scribble
it down. ‘Dear Mrs. Froplinson—thank you and
your husband so much for the very pretty calendar
you sent us. It was very good of you to think of
igs.”

“You can't possibly say that,’ said Janetta,
laying down her pen.

“It's what I always do say, and what every one
says to me,” protested Egbert.

“We sent them something on the twenty-second,”
said Janetta, “so they simply Aad to think of us.

There was no getting away from it.”
