THE BLIND SPOT

cc DR ton just come back from Adelaide's

funeral, haven't you?” said Sir Lul-
worth to his nephew; “I suppose it
was very like most other funerals?”
“Tl tell you all about it at lunch,” said Egbert.
“You'll do nothing of the sort. It wouldn't be
respectful either to your great-aunt's memory or
to the lunch. We begin with Spanish olives, then
a borshch, then more olives and a bird of some kind,
and a rather enticing Rhenish wine, not at all expen-
sive as wines go in this country, but still quite laud-
able in its way. Now there's absolutely nothing in
that menu that harmonises in the least with the sub-
ject of your great-aunt Adelaide or her funeral. She
was a charming woman, and quite as intelligent as she
had any need to be, but somehow she always reminded
me of an English cook's idea of a Madras curry.”
“She used to say you were frivolous,” said
Egbert. Something in his tone suggested that he
rather endorsed the verdict.
