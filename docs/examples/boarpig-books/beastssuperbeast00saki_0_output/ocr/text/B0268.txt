question of the woman's nationality. He had
acquired a smattering of Slavonic tongues during
his residence in Vienna, and felt competent to grapple

“If she is Magyar, heaven help me! We shall
have to converse entirely by signs.”

He entered the carriage and made his momentous
announcement in the best approach to Croat speech
that he could achieve.
