THE NAME-DAY 273

When he looked at last a new sensation of scan-
dalised astonishment took possession of him. He
had been straitly brought up in a small English
town, and he was not prepared to be the witness of
a miracle. The wolves were not doing anything
worse to the woman than drench her with snow
as they gambolled round her.

A short, joyous bark revealed the clue to the
situation.

“Are those—dogs?” he called weakly.

“My cousin Karl's dogs, yes,’ she answered;
“that is his inn, over beyond the trees. I knew it
was there, but I did not want to take you there;
he is always grasping with strangers. However,
it grows too cold to remain in the train. Ah, ah,
see what comes!”

A whistle sounded, and a relief engine made its
appearance, snorting its way sulkily through the
snow. Abbleway did not have the opportunity for
finding out whether Karl was really avaricious.
