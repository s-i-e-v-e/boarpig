hours won't hurt her,” said Clovis, with the air of
one who has taken everything into consideration;
“one of your men could bring her over from Pabham
Park after dusk, and with a little help he ought to
be able to smuggle her into the conservatory at the
same moment that Mary Hampton makes an unob-
trusive exit.”

Lord Pabham stared at Clovis for a moment in
pardonable bewilderment; then his face broke into
a wrinkled network of laughter.

“Oh, that's your game, is it? You are going to
do a little Siberian Magic on your own account.
And is Mrs. Hampton willing to be a fellow-con-
spirator?”

“Mary is pledged to see me through with it, if
you will guarantee Louisa's temper.”

“[ll answer for Louisa,” said Lord Pabham.

By the following day the house-party had swollen
to larger proportions, and Bilsiter's instinct for self-
advertisement expanded duly under the stimulant
of an increased audience. At dinner that evening
he held forth at length on the subject of unseen
forces and untested powers, and his flow of
impressive eloquence continued unabated while
coffee was being served in the drawing-room pre-
paratory to a general migration to the card-room.
