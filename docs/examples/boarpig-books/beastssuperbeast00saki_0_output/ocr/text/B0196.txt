196 BEASTS AND SUPER-BEASTS

He was shown all the Aylesbury ducklings and the
row of wooden hives where there would have been
bees if there had not been bee disease. He was
also taken to the end of a long lane and shown a
distant mound whereon local tradition reported
that the Danes had once pitched a camp. And
when his hostess had to desert him temporarily
for other duties he would find Evelyn walking
solemnly by his side. Evelyn was fourteen and
talked chiefly about good and evil, and of how much
one might accomplish in the way of regenerating
the world if one was thoroughly determined to do
one's utmost. It was generally rather a relief when
she was displaced by Jack, who was nine years old,
and talked exclusively about the Balkan War with--
out throwing any fresh light on its political or
military history. The German governess told Lanner
more about Schiller than he had ever heard in his
life about any one person; it was perhaps his own
fault for having told her that he was not interested
in Goethe. When the governess went off picket
duty the hostess was again on hand with a not-to-be--
gainsaid invitation to visit the cottage of an old
woman who remembered Charles James Fox; the
woman had been dead for â€˜wo or three years, but
the cottage was still there. Lanner was called
back to town earlier than he had orig: nally intended.
