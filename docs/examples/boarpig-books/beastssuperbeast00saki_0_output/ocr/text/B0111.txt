THE SEVENTH PULLET III

wrote from the North of Scotland recounting a
similar episode which she had witnessed as occurring
between a stoat and a blind grouse. Somehow a
lie seems so much less reprehensible when one can
call it a lee.

For awhile the adapter of the Seventh Pullet
story enjoyed to the full his altered standing as a
person of consequence, one who had had some
share in the strange events of his times. Then
he was thrust once again into the cold grey back-
ground by the sudden blossoming into importance
of Smith-Paddon, a daily fellow-traveller, whose
little girl had been knocked down and nearly hurt by
a car belonging to a musical-comedy actress. The
actress was not in the car at the time, but she was
in numerous photographs which appeared in the
illustrated papers of Zoto Dobreen inquiring after
the well-being of Maisie, daughter of Edmund
Smith-Paddon, Esq. With this new human interest
to absorb them the travelling companions were
almost rude when Blenkinthrope tried to explain
his contrivance for keeping vipers and peregrine
falcons out of his chicken-run.

Gorworth, to whom he unburdened himself in
private, gave him the same counsel as heretofore.

“Invent something.”

“Yes, but what?”
