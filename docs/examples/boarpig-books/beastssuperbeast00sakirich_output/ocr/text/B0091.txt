THE ROMANCERS QI

the professional cadger, the man who would undergo
hours of humiliating tale-spinning and rebuff rather
than adventure on half a day's decent work.

For a while the new-comer fixed his eyes straight
in front of him in a strenuous, unseeing gaze; then
his voice broke out with the insinuating inflection
of one who has a story to retail well worth any
loiterer's while to listen to.

“It's a strange world,” he said.

As the statement met with no response he altered
it to the form of a question.

“I daresay you've found it to be a strange world,
mister?”

“As far as I am concerned,” said Crosby, “the
strangeness has worn off in the course of thirty-six
years.”

“Ah,” said the greybeard, “I could tell you
things that you'd hardly believe. Marvellous things
that have really happened to me.”

“Nowadays there is no demand for marvellous
things that have really happened,’ said Crosby
discouragingly; “the professional writers of fiction
turn these things out so much better. For instance,
my neighbours tell me wonderful, incredible things
that their Aberdeens and chows and borzois have
done; I never listen tothem. On the other hand,I have
read ‘The Hound of the Baskervilles’ three times.”
