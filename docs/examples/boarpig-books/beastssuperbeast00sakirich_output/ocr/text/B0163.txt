THE BYZANTINE OMELETTE 163

grievance against you personally, but they demand
that Gaspare should be immediately dismissed.”

“But,” protested Sophie, ‘he is the only man in
England who understands how to make a Byzantine
omelette. I engaged him specially for the Duke of
Syria's visit, and it would be impossible to replace
him at short notice. I should have to send to Paris,
and the Duke loves Byzantine omelettes. It was
the one thing we talked about coming from the
station.”

“He was one of the strike-breakers at Lord
Grimford's,” reiterated Richardson.

“This is too awful,” said Sophie; “a strike of
servants at a moment like this, with the Duke of
Syria staying in the house. Something must be
done immediately. Quick, finish my hair and I'll
go and see what I can do to bring them round.”

“I can't finish your hair, madame,” said Richard--
son quietly, but with immense decision. “I belong
to the union and I can't do another half-minute's
work till the strike is settled. I'm sorry to be dis--
obliging.”

“But this is inhuman!’ exclaimed Sophie
tragically; “I've always been a model mistress
and I've refused to employ any but union servants,
and thisis the result. I can't finish my hair myself; I
don't know how to. What am I to do? It's wicked!”
