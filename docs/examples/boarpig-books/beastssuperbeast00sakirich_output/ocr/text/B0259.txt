DOWN PENS 289

Again Janetta laid down her pen.

“Do you realise what that means?” she asked;
** a Wordsworth booklet next Christmas, and another
calendar the Christmas after, with the same problem
of having to write suitable letters of thankfulness.
No, the best thing to do 1s to drop all further allusion
to the calendar and switch off on to some other
topic.”

“But what other topic?”

“Oh, something like this: ‘What do you think
of the New Year Honours List? A friend of ours
made such a clever remark when he read it.’ Then
you can stick in any remark that comes into your
head; it needn't be clever. The Froplinsons won't
know whether it is or isn't.”

“We don't even know on which side they are in
politics,” objected Egbert; “and anyhow you can't
suddenly dismiss the subject of the calendar.
Surely there must be some intelligent remark that
can be made about it.”

“Well, we can't think of one,” said Janetta
wearily; “the fact is, we've both written ourselves
out. Heavens! I've just remembered Mrs. Stephen
Ludberry. I haven't thanked her for what she
sent.”

“What did she send?”

“TI forget; I think it was a calendar.”
