THE FORBIDDEN BUZZARDS 197

Hugo did not bring off his affair with Betty
Coulterneb. Whether she refused him or whether,
as was more generally supposed, he did not get a
chance of saying three consecutive words, has never
been exactly ascertained. Anyhow, she is still the
jolly Coulterneb girl.

The buzzards successfully reared two young ones,
which were shot by a local hairdresser.
