ticket on the bag, he announced in a clear, dispas--

“Black seal, thirty-four shillings, marked down
to twenty-eight. Asa matter of fact, we areclearing
them out at a special reduction price of twenty--
six shillings. They are going off rather fast.”

will be a matter of a few minutes to get it wrapped
up, there is such a crush.”

“Never mind, Ill take it as it is,” said the pur--
chaser, clutching her treasureand counting the money
into Cyprian's palm.
