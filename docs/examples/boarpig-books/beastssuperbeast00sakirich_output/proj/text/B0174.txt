“They might sting him to death,” protested
Mrs. Thackenbury.

“Waldo is one of those people who would be
enormously improved by death,” said Clovis; “but
if you didn't want to go as far as that, you could
have some wet straw ready to hand, and set it
alight under the hammock at the same time that
the fusee was thrown into the nest; the smoke
would keep all but the most militant of the wasps
just outside the stinging line, and as long as Waldo
remained within its protection he would escape
serious damage, and could be eventually restored
to his mother, kippered all over and swollen in
places, but still perfectly recognisable.”

“His mother would be my enemy for life,” said
Mrs. Thackenbury.

“That would be one greeting less to exchange at
Christmas,” said Clovis.
