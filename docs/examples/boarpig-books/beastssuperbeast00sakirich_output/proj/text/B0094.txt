“In the town of Yom,” said Crosby, “which is
in Southern Afghanistan, and which also happens
to be my birthplace, there was a Chinese philosopher
who used to say that one of the three chiefest human
blessings was to be absolutely without money. I
forget what the other two were.”

“Ah, I daresay,” said the stranger, in a tone that
betrayed no enthusiasm for the philosopher's
memory; “and did he practise what he preached?
That's the test.”

“He lived happily with very little money or
resources,” said Crosby.

“Then I expect he had friends who would help
him liberally whenever he was in difficulties, such
as I am in at present.”

“In Yom,” said Crosby, “it is not necessary
to have friends in order to obtain help. Any citizen
of Yom would help a stranger as a matter of course.”

The greybeard was now genuinely interested.
The conversation had at last taken a favourable
turn.

“If someone, like me, for instance, who was in
undeserved difficulties, asked a citizen of that town
you speak of for a small loan to tide over a few days'
impecuniosity—five shillings, or perhaps a rather
larger sum—would it be given to him as a matter of
course?”
