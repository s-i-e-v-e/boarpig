“Me?”

Clovis nodded.

“Who on earth does he think I am?”

“Queen Anne,” was the unexpected answer.

“Queen Anne! What an idea. But, anyhow,
there's nothing dangerous about her; she's such
a colourless personality.”

“What does posterity chiefly say about Queen
Anne?” asked Clovis rather sternly.

“The only thing that I can remember about her,”
said Jane, “is the saying ‘Queen Anne's dead.’”

“Exactly,” said Clovis, staring at the glass that
had held the Ella Wheeler Wilcox, “dead.”

“Do you mean he takes me for the ghost of Queen
Anne?” asked Jane.

“Ghost? Dear no. No one ever heard of a
ghost that came down to breakfast and ate kidneys
and toast and honey with a healthy appetite. No,
it's the fact of you being so very much alive and
flourishing that perplexes and annoys him. All his
life he has been accustomed to look on Queen Anne
as the personification of everything that is dead and
done with, ‘as dead as Queen Anne,’ you know;
and now he has to fill your glass at lunch and dinner
and listen to your accounts of the gay time you had
at the Dublin Horse Show, and naturally he feels
that something's very wrong with you.”
