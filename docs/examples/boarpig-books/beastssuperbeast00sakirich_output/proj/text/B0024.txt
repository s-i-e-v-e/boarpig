Tarquin Superbus isn't loose in the paddock.
After all, as every one else is enjoying themselves,
I don't see why Tarquin shouldn't have an after-
noon out.”

Matilda was of an age when thought is action;
she slid down from the branches of the medlar
tree, and when she clambered back again Tarquin,
the huge white Yorkshire boar-pig, had exchanged
the narrow limits of his stye for the wider range of
the grass paddock. The discomfited Stossen expedi-
tion, returning in recriminatory but otherwise orderly
retreat from the unyielding obstacle of the locked
door, came to a sudden halt at the gate dividing
the paddock from the gooseberry garden.

“What a villainous-looking animal,” exclaimed
Mrs. Stossen; “it wasn't there when we came in.”

“It's there now, anyhow,” said her daughter.
“What on earth are we to do? I wish we had
never come.”

The boar-pig had drawn nearer to the gate for
a closer inspection of the human intruders, and
stood champing his jaws and blinking his small
red eyes in a manner that was doubtless intended
to be disconcerting, and, as far as the Stossens were
concerned, thoroughly achieved that result.

“Shoo! Hish! Hish! Shoo!” cried the ladies
in chorus.
