“That is quite possible,” said Sir Nicholas.

Dinner that evening was not a particularly lively
affair; the strain of trying to impersonate a self-
imposed character or to glean hints of identity from
other people's conduct acted as a check on the
natural festivity of such a gathering. There was a
general feeling of gratitude and acquiescence when
good-natured Rachel Klammerstein suggested that
there should be an hour or two's respite from “the
game” while they all listened to a little piano-playing
after dinner. Rachel's love of piano music was not in-
discriminate, and concentrated itself chiefly on selec-
tions rendered by her idolised offspring, Moritz and Aug-
usta, who, to do them justice, played remarkably well.

The Klammersteins were deservedly popular as
Christmas guests; they gave expensive gifts lavishly
on Christmas Day and New Year, and Mrs. Klam-
merstein had already dropped hints of her intention
to present the prize for the best enacted character
in the game competition. Every one had brightened
at this prospect; if it had fallen to Lady Blonze,
as hostess, to provide the prize, she would have
considered that a little souvenir of some twenty or
twenty-five shillings' value would meet the case,
whereas coming from a Klammerstein source it
would certainly run to several guineas.
