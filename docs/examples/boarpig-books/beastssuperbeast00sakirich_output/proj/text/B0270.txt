“They may attack us here,” said Abbleway
tremulously; “they could easily break in, these
carriages are like matchwood. We may both be
devoured.”

“You, perhaps,” said the woman calmly; “not
me.”

“Why not you?” demanded Abbleway.

“It is the day of Saint Mariä Kleophä, my name-
day. She would not allow me to be eaten by wolves
on her day. Such a thing could not be thought of.
You, yes, but not me.”

Abbleway changed the subject.

“It is only afternoon now; if we are to be left here
till morning we shall be starving.”

“I have here some good eatables,” said the
woman tranquilly; “on my festival day it is natural
that I should have provision with me. I have five
good blood-sausages; in the town shops they cost
twenty-five heller each. Things are dear in the
town shops.”

“I will give you fifty heller apiece for a couple
of them,” said Abbleway with some enthusiasm.

“In a railway accident things become very dear,”
said the woman; “these blood-sausages are four
kronen apiece.”

“Four kronen!” exclaimed Abbleway; “four
kronen for a blood-sausage!”
