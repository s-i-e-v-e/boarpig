The ready affirmative coupled with the question
betrayed a significant shifting of the ethical stand-
point.

It was a few days later that Blenkinthrope revealed
a chapter of family history to the customary gathering
in the railway carriage.

“Curious thing happened to my aunt, the one
who lives in Paris,” he began. He had several
aunts, but they were all geographically distributed
over Greater London.

“She was sitting on a seat in the Bois the other after-
noon, after lunching at the Roumanian Legation.”

Whatever the story gained in picturesqueness
from the dragging-in of diplomatic “atmosphere,”
it ceased from that moment to command any accept-
ance as a record of current events. Gorworth had
warned his neophyte that this would be the case,
but the traditional enthusiasm of the neophyte had
triumphed over discretion.

“She was feeling rather drowsy, the effect prob-
ably of the champagne, which she's not in the habit
of taking in the middle of the day.”

A subdued murmur of admiration went round the
company. Blenkinthrope's aunts were not used
to taking champagne in the middle of the year,
regarding it exclusively as a Christmas and New Year
accessory.
