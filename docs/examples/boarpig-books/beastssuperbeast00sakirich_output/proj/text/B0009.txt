“Oh, never mind its Latin name,” screamed
Mavis, as the beast came a step or two further into
the room; “can't you entice it away with food,
and shut it up where it can't do any harm?”

“If it is really Mrs. Hampton, who has just had
a very good dinner, I don't suppose food will appeal
to it very strongly,” said Clovis.

“Leonard,” beseeched Mrs. Hoops tearfully,
“even if this (i is) none of your doing can't you use
your great powers to turn this dreadful beast into
something harmless before it bites us all—a rabbit
or something?”

“I don't suppose Colonel Hampton would care
to have his wife turned into a succession of fancy
animals as though we were playing a round game
with her,” interposed Clovis.

“I absolutely forbid it,” thundered the Colonel.

“Most wolves that I've had anything to do with
have been inordinately fond of sugar,” said Lord
Pabham; “if you like I'll try the effect on this one.”
