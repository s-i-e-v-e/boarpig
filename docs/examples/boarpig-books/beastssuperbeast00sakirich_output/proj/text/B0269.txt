(fw (h THE NAME-DAY)(pg 269))

“The train has broken away and left us!”

The woman shook her head with a movement
that might be intended to convey resignation to the
will of heaven, but probably meant noncompre-
hension. Abbleway repeated his information with
variations of Slavonic tongues and generous displays
of pantomime.

“Ah,” said the woman at last in German dialect,
“the train has gone? We are left. Ah, so.”

She seemed about as much interested as though
Abbleway had told her the result of the municipal
elections in Amsterdam.

“They will find out at some station, and when the
line is clear of snow they will send an engine. It
happens that way sometimes.”

“We may be here all night!” exclaimed Abbleway.

The woman nodded as though she thought it
possible.

“Are there wolves in these parts?” asked Abble-
way hurriedly.

“Many,” said the woman; “just outside this
forest my aunt was devoured three years ago, as
she was coming home from market. The horse and
a young pig that was in the cart were eaten too.
The horse was a very old one, but it was a beautiful
young pig, oh, so fat. I cried when I heard that it
was taken. They spare nothing.”
