sibly I was mistaken.”

“I paint dairy cows, certainly,” admitted Eshley,
“but I cannot claim to have had any experience
in rounding-up stray oxen. I've seen it done on a
cinema film, of course, but there were always horses
and lots of other accessories; besides, one never
knows how much of those pictures are faked.”

Adela Pingsford said nothing, but led the way
to her garden. It was normally a fair-sized garden,
but it looked small in comparison with the ox, a
huge mottled brute, dull red about the head and
shoulders, passing to dirty white on the flanks and
hind-quarters, with shaggy ears and large blood-
shot eyes. It bore about as much resemblance to
the dainty paddock heifers that Eshley was accus-
tomed to paint as the chief of a Kurdish nomad clan
would to a Japanese tea-shop girl. Eshley stood
very near the gate while he studied the animal's
appearance and demeanour. Adela Pingsford con-
tinued to say nothing.

“It's eating a chrysanthemum,” said Eshley
at last, when the silence had become unbearable.

“How observant you are,” said Adela bitterly.
“You seem to notice everything. As a matter of
fact, it has got six chrysanthemums in its mouth at
the present moment.”
