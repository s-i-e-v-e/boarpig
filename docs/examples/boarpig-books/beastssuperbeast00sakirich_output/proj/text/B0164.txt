“Wicked is the word,” said Richardson; “I'm
a good Conservative and I've no patience with this
Socialist foolery, asking your pardon. It's tyranny,
that's what it is, all along the line, but I've my living to
make, same as other people, and I've got to belong to
the union. I couldn't touch another hair-pin without
a strike permit, not if you was to double my wages.”

The door burst open and Catherine Malsom raged
into the room.

“Here's a nice affair,” she screamed, “a strike
of household servants without a moment's warning,
and I'm left like this! I can't appear in public
in this condition.”

After a very hasty scrutiny Sophie assured her
that she could not.

“Have they (i all) struck?” she asked her maid.

“Not the kitchen staff,” said Richardson, “they
belong to a different union.”

“Dinner at least will be assured,” said Sophie,
“that is something to be thankful for.”

“Dinner!” snorted Catherine, “what on earth
is the good of dinner when none of us will be able
to appear at it? Look at your hair—and look at
me! or rather, don't.”

“I know it's difficult to manage without a maid;
can't your husband be any help to you?” asked
Sophie despairingly.
